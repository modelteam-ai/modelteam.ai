At **[modelteam](https://modelteam.ai)**, we develop proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate engineers’
skills and
capabilities by examining code and technical documentations. We use these models, learned from a training set of
millions of engineers, to develop a unique data assets that powers a vertical talent insight platform for software
engineers. Our platform helps teams identify and retain top talent and ensures the best engineers are matched to the
right roles, optimizing performance and success.

Our AI platform extracts insights from engineering team's day-to-day work products, including code and technical
documentation. Thereby, modelteam provides a comprehensive and accurate assessment of engineers' skills, expertise, and
coding quality.

modelteam is built on a robust foundation of training data from over a million engineers' contributions to open-source
projects, spanning 9 programming languages.

## Confidentiality & Security

We understand the importance of confidentiality and security of your code and data. Modelteam.ai will use your code only
to extract the stats and skills. We will remove the code immediately after extracting the stats and skills. These stats
will be used to build your team's profile and will be accessible only to our your authorized team members and our AI
models.
