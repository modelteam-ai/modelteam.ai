# Privacy Policy for ModelTeam

**Effective Date: 2024-09-01**

At ModelTeam, we are committed to protecting the privacy and security of the personal and professional information of our users, clients, and engineering candidates. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of information we collect, how we use that information, and the rights users have regarding their data.

### 1. Information We Collect
We collect a variety of data types as part of our talent assessment services, including but not limited to:

**Personal Information:**

* Contact details such as name, email address, and phone number.
* Professional information including job title, company, work experience, and skills.

**Assessment Results:**

* Results of our proprietary LLMs analyzing engineers' skills, capabilities, and code quality.
* Team-fit and performance evaluation data based on our AI-powered assessments.

**Cookies and Usage Data:**

* Information collected through tracking technologies such as cookies to analyze website traffic and user interactions with our platform.

### 2. How We Use Your Information
The information we collect is used for several purposes, including:

* **Recruiting and Hiring Decisions**: We analyze code quality, performance, and skill expertise to help our clients make data-driven hiring decisions.
* **Talent Assessment**: Our assessments identify gaps in skills, helping companies manage training, performance, and team composition more effectively.
* **Platform Development**: The data helps us improve our AI models and overall platform functionality, enhancing the accuracy and relevance of our engineering assessments.

### 3. Data Handling and Storage
* **Technical Data**: ModelTeam does not collect or store technical data (e.g., source code or technical documentation). The software and LLM models you download and run execute within your own environment. All technical processing occurs on your systems, and ModelTeam only receives the assessment insights after processing is complete.
* **Assessment Insights Collection**: We collect the assessment results generated by the software post-processing, which provide valuable insights into engineer skills and capabilities. This ensures that no sensitive code or documentation ever leaves your environment.
* **Personal and Professional Information**: We store contact and professional information for users to manage accounts, provide services, and improve our offerings.

### 4. Data Sharing and Disclosure
ModelTeam does not sell, rent, or trade your personal data to third parties. However, we may share information in the following cases:

* **With Clients**: We provide your assessment results and related insights to prospective employers or clients for recruiting, hiring, and team management purposes.
* **With Service Providers**: We may share information with third-party service providers who assist us in delivering our services (e.g., cloud storage, analytics).
* **As Required by Law**: We may disclose information when legally obligated, such as in response to a subpoena, court order, or regulatory request.


### 5. Data Security
We use industry-standard security measures to protect the data we collect. This includes encryption, access controls, and secure storage to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of all data handled by ModelTeam. Despite these measures, no method of data transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.


### 6. Data Retention
We retain personal and professional data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this policy, including compliance with legal, accounting, or reporting obligations. Data may be retained in an anonymized form for longer periods to assist in developing and improving our models. Technical data is not stored and is discarded after use.


### 7. Your Data Rights
Depending on your location and applicable laws, you may have the following rights regarding your data:

* **Access**: You can request a copy of the personal information we hold about you.
* **Correction**: You can request that we correct or update any inaccurate data.
* **Deletion**: You can request that we delete your personal information, subject to certain exceptions (e.g., compliance with legal obligations).
* **Restriction of Processing**: You can request that we limit how your personal information is used.
* **Data Portability**: You can request that we provide your data in a commonly used, machine-readable format.


### 8. Data Location and Transfers
ModelTeam maintains all data exclusively within the United States. We do not engage in international data transfers. All personal and professional data are processed and stored on servers located in the U.S.


### 9. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal obligations. Any changes will be posted on this page, and we encourage you to review the policy periodically.
