## Getting Started

![Getting Started](images/getting_started.png)

- Create a folder `modelteam` and navigate to it.
- Create `modelteam/repos` folder
- Clone all the repositories you want to include in your profile to `modelteam/repos`
- Run the following command to generate your profile
    - **IMPORTANT: Run this in a night-time or when you are not using the computer as it will take some time and consume
      a lot of resources**
    - Generates PDF profile for your personal use and a JSON file for creating your modelteam.ai verified profile
### 1. Setup
- Clone the modelteam.ai repository
- Run the setup script to download the dependencies and models to your local machine
```bash
mkdir modelteam;cd modelteam
# Clone / Copy all the repositories you want to include in your profile
# This can be any path, as long as they all are in a single folder
mkdir repos;cd repos
git clone <repo1>
git clone <repo2>
cp -r <repo3> .
...
...
cd ..
# Get the modelteam.ai code
git clone https://github.com/modelteam-ai/modelteam.ai.git
cd modelteam.ai
# Generates venv and installs dependencies. It will download all the AI models
./setup.sh
```
### 2 Build your profile
- For this step, no internet access is required. Everything stays on your local machine
- Scans all the repositories in the `repos` folder and generates a JSON file with your profile
#### 2.a. For Individuals
```bash
# Generates your profile. Takes email used in git commits and optionally number of years to consider
# Number of years is optional and defaults to 5 years. It's recommended to change it to your years of experience
./build_my_profile.sh -r <repos_path> -e <email> [-n <number_of_years>]
# e.g. ./build_my_profile.sh -r /home/user/repos -e user@org.ai -n 5
```
#### 2.b. For Organizations
```bash
# Generates your team profile. Takes a list of emails or team name and optionally number of years to consider
# Number of years is optional and defaults to 5 years. It's recommended to reduce it as per your needs
./build_team_profile.sh -r <repos_path> -e "<email1>,<email2>,..." -t "team_name" [-n <number_of_years>]
# e.g. ./build_team_profile.sh -r /home/user/repos -e user1@org.ai,user2@org.ai -t model_team -n 3
```

### 3. Upload
#### 3.a. For Individuals
- Verify the generated profile and remove any unwanted/confidential information
- Encrypt the JSON file using the provided key and upload it to your account in modelteam.ai
  - Key will be emailed to you
```bash
# If you are using linux server without GUI, use --cli_mode
./edit_and_sign.sh <key> [--cli_mode]
# e.g. ./edit_and_sign.sh 2b7e151628aed2a6abf7158809cf4f3c --cli_mode
# e.g. ./edit_and_sign.sh 2b7e151628aed2a6abf7158809cf4f3c  # For MacOS
```
#### 3.b. For Organizations
- Just upload the generated JSON file to create your team in modelteam.ai
