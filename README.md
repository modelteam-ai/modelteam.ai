## Getting Started

![Getting Started](images/getting_started.png)

- Create a folder `modelteam` and navigate to it.
- Create `modelteam/repos` folder
- Clone all the repositories you want to include in your profile to `modelteam/repos`
- Run the following command to generate your profile
    - **IMPORTANT: Run this in a night-time or when you are not using the computer as it will take some time and consume
      a lot of resources**
    - Generates PDF profile for your personal use and a JSON file for creating your modelteam.ai verified profile
### Step 1
```bash
mkdir modelteam;cd modelteam
# Get the modelteam.ai code
git clone https://github.com/modelteam-ai/modelteam.ai.git
cd modelteam.ai
# Generates venv and installs dependencies. It will download all the AI models
./setup.sh
# Clone / Copy all the repositories you want to include in your profile
mkdir repos;cd repos
git clone <repo1>
git clone <repo2>
cp -r <repo3> .
...
...
cd ..
```
### Step 2
```bash
# For this step, internet access is not required
# Generates your profile. Takes email used in git commits and optionally number of years to consider
# Number of years is optional and defaults to 10 years. It's recommended to change it to your years of experience
./build_my_profile.sh modelteam/repos <email> [<number_of_years>]
# Verify the generated profile and remove any unwanted/confidential information
# Key will be emailed to you. JSON file will be encrypted using this key.
# If you are using linux server without GUI, use --cli_mode
./edit_and_sign.sh <key> [--cli_mode]
```

### Step 3
  - Upload the encrypted json profile to modelteam.ai
